# Satellite-Image-Classification
The dataset Satellite available in package mlbench contains 6435 images displaying different scenes recorded by the Landsat satellite program. Each row of the data correspond to an image, which encodes a scene in terms of 36 features extracted from multi-spectral values of pixels in 3x3 neighbourhoods of the image. According to the central pixel in each neighbourhood, images are classified into 6 type of scenery: cotton_crop, damp_grey_soil, grey_soil, red_soil, soil_with_vegetation_stubble, very_damp_grey_soil. The aim is to predict the classification of a satellite image, given the multi-spectral values.
